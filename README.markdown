# Coverflow Implementation using UICollectionView

## WIP

This is a work in progress. 

## Why?

This is an iPhone project implementing Coverflow using iOS 6 UICollectionViews and a custom UICollectionViewLayout

Yes Apple demoed this at WWDC but I think the interpolation technique I use is rather neat and allows you to easily adjust the layout and behavior of the layout.

## CInterpolator

CInterpolator objects are a little like CAKeyFrameAnimation objects except they're not necessarily time based. You can use them for (linear) key frame interpolation between any keys and values

## It doesn't work

See the WIP section

## What will work when it's done

* Coverflow layout.
* Snap to focused cell
* Reflections
